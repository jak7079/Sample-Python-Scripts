Sample-Python-Scripts
=====================

Sample Python Scripts is a repository of sample python scripts

LibraryInfo.py:  This script downloads the html code that lists the Columbia University libraries, parses the data for library names, extended descriptions (if available), and email addresses, and then prints that data for each library in the terminal.

msuCSE231proj08.py:  This script is a solution to the MSU CSE 231 problem found at http://bit.ly/YzZdZF. The script reads and parses training data to determine attributes for two classes of wage-earners. The script then reads in exercise data and for each record uses a simple algorithm that compares the record's attirbutes with those in the training set to guess which class the record belongs to, records whether it was correct, and outputs its accuracy to the console.
