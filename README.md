Sample-Python-Scripts
=====================

This is a repository of sample Python scripts

<b>dwollaMerchantFind.py</b>: This script, which requires a <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/applications/create">Dwolla API key</a>, displays the nearest merchants that accept <a href = "https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a>. The user enters an address or location and a maximum number of results to display, the location is converted to geocoordinates using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/">Google Maps Geocode API</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-python">Dwolla Python API</a> is queried for the list of users nearest that point, and the results are printed out along with an estimate of how far each merchant is from the address. By default the query is set to a two-mile radius, but if fewer than the maximum number of results are returned, the query is expanded (up to 50 miles) until a sufficient number of results are returned.
	
<b>dwollaUserTransactions.py</b>: This script displays a <a href = "https://www.dwolla.com/">Dwolla</a> user's name, account number, current account balance, and a summary of their last five transactions. It uses the <a href="https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-python">Dwolla Python API</a> and requires a <a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/dev/token">Dwolla API Token</a>.

<b>libraryInfo.py</b>:  This script downloads the html code that lists the <a href="http://library.columbia.edu/locations.html">Columbia University libraries</a>, parses the data for library names, extended descriptions (if available), and email addresses, and then prints that data for each library in the terminal.

<b>map_directions.py</b>:  This script prints directions between user-specified start and end points. It guesses the user's point of origin by finding their IP address using <a href="http://ip.jsontest.com/">http://ip.jsontest.com/</a> and the location associated with the IP address using <a href="http://www.geobytes.com/">http://www.geobytes.com/</a>. The script asks the user if they would like to use the guessed point or one of their choosing, and then asks a destination and an optional waypoint. The script then querys the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/">Google Directions API</a> and prints out step-by-step directions, keeping track of cumulative distance and time. The script also queries the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/">Google Streetview API</a> to download and display an image of the destination if one is available.

<b>msuCSE231proj08.py</b>:  This script is a solution to the MSU CSE 231 problem found at http://bit.ly/YzZdZF. The script reads and parses training data to determine attributes for two classes of wage-earners. The script then reads in exercise data and uses a simple algorithm to try to guess which class the record belongs to by comparing the record's attributes with those in the training set. It records whether its guess was correct and outputs its accuracy to the console.

<b>msuCSE231proj10.py</b>:  This script is a solution to the MSU CSE 231 problem found at http://bit.ly/1pzV5PC. It uses various classes to simulate an elevator responding to passenger calls. The user inputs the number of passengers and the number of floors in the building. The script then creates Building, Elevator, and Passenger objects based on the input data. The program randomly assigns origin and destination floors to each passenger. The elevator starts at floor 1 and picks each passenger up, recording when they get on, when they get off, how many passengers are riding the elevator at any time, and whether a passenger's journey is complete.
